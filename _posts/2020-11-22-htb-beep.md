We'll kick things off with an nmap scan.

There's a lot to take in on this system. We'll keep things simple and poke around the web server. Port 80 auto redirects us to port 443. We're presented with an Elastix PBX login page.

Elastix has a few exploits that we might be able to make use of. After some trial and error, we find that this is version 2.2.0. We'll use the LFI exploit involving graph.php to grab some information from the system.

Instead of running the Perl script, we can just grab the URL and run it manually.

To make things a bit easier to look at we can save the contents to a file and use sed and grep to make things nice and neat.

We can see the re-use of the password "jEhdlekWmdjE" for a few fields. We'll grab the passwd file and see if any of those accounts are actual system accounts. Just replace "amportal.conf" with "passwd" in the URL.

We'll do the same thing with this to clean things up for easy reading.

Although we don't see any of those account names, it's possible that the password is still used by another account on the system. We'll stip the usernames into a separate file.

Now we can use Metasploit to test every account via SSH using that password.

It looks like we're in luck. Not only is the password being used, but it's being used by the root account. We can now drop into the session and grab the flags.
